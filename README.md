# DBLP-Parser

A parser written for a class project for the [DBLP dataset](http://dblp.uni-trier.de/).  The parser uses the SAX library to iterate through the raw DBLP XML file and write the elements to CSV files. These files in turn can be easily imported into a MySQL backend. Credit to Github user interesaat's own [parser](https://github.com/interesaaat/dblpImporter), which was a very useful reference when writing this parser.
